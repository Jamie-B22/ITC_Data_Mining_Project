# ITC Data Mining Project

### Description

This is a web scraper built for a data mining project with ITC (https://www.itc.tech/). 

It scrapes data from Goodreads to provide the book included in various "top" lists, 
and then gives details about all the books on the list


### Usage

Currently controlled by setting the variables for TYPE and DETAILS either in the configuration or as arguments in the command line

`python3 main.py TYPE DETAILS`

#### EX:

Most read in Israel in the last month:

`TYPE = "most-read"`

`DETAILS = "ILm"`

or

`python3 main.py most-read ILm`


### Installation
